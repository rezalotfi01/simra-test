# Simra Test Movie App

Offline-First Interview Test App Built with MVVM Modular Clean architecture using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com)

### Why Modular? 
Going modular gives you lots of benefits such as :
- Faster build time
- Less coupling / dependencies
- Flexibility to adopt different architecture for different module
- On demand feature delivery using Dynamic Module 

## Structure & Concept

### Main Modules
#### App
You can basically leave this one out. App Module is now as small as possible and only used as entry point.
#### Data
This is your module for your data source. Connect to your API, manage cache, creating entities happened here.
#### Features
Each feature must be contained in a separate gradle module.
#### Navigation
This is used for routing purposes, especially between modules.
#### Common
Contains reusable classes and resources that you can use in another modules. We have already added some useful common features that you will need to start your project.
#### Common_Test
Contains Unit Tests that designed for common classes
